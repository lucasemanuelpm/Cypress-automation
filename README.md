🚀 QA Automation with Cypress | E-commerce Testing  

Welcome to my QA Automation repository! This project showcases my expertise in automated testing using Cypress, where I have tested five different e-commerce platforms to ensure functionality, performance, and user experience.  

🛠️ Technologies Used:  
- Cypress: End-to-end testing framework for UI automation  
- JavaScript: Scripting language for test implementation  
- Mocha & Chai: Assertion libraries used with Cypress  
- Allure Report: For detailed test reporting  
- GitHub Actions: CI/CD pipeline integration for automated test execution  

🔍 Tested E-commerce Platforms:  
- Anonymous – Validated search functionality, cart management, and checkout process  
- Anonymous – Tested user authentication, product listing, and payment gateways  
- Anonymous  – Ensured seamless navigation and responsive design  
- Anonymous – Checked product availability, filtering, and order placement  
- Anonymous – Verified user interactions, security measures, and API responses  

✅ Key Test Scenarios:  
- User Authentication: Login, signup, and session handling  
- Product Search & Filtering: Ensuring accurate search results and filter functionality  
- Cart & Checkout Process: Adding/removing items, order summary validation  
- Payment Gateway Testing: Validating secure transactions and order confirmation  
- Performance & Load Testing: Analyzing response times and handling high traffic  

📊 Test Execution & Reporting:  
- Automated test scripts are executed via Cypress Test Runner  
- Allure Reports provide comprehensive test execution insights  
- Continuous Integration using GitHub Actions for scheduled test runs
